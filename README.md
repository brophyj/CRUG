Chicago R Users Group presentation code

These are the presentation files and the R code that demonstrates the scrapeR package for a Chicago R User's Group 
presentation.  beamer.pdf has the presentation slides, and CRUG example.R has example code.  The code scrapes team 
points from NHL.com and team fights from HockeyFights.com, matches the two, and plots the results.  I included the 
other files so the curious user can see how I used Beamer (a LaTeX presentation program) to create the slides.
